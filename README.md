# Javascript News app

### Learning Objectives

- Be able to create a multi-component web application, with Vue
- Be able to make API requests to load JSON data into your application

## Brief

Create an application that makes a request to an API and displays the data.

### MVP:

The application should display data from an API request.
The application should have a clear separation of concerns (multiple components)
Take input from the user to update the page. You could update the page by filtering or manipulating the data on user interaction, or you might make further API requests to load more data that is then displayed.

## Chosen API:

Guardian search: https://content.guardianapis.com/search?q=brexit&format=json&api-key=test
These APIs all allow browser requests without authentication or keys. (In the case of the Guardian, api-key=test should be sufficient.)

## To view the application running:

download or clone the repository.

In the terminal: cd into the repository folder 

`npm install`

`cd public`

`npm run serve`
